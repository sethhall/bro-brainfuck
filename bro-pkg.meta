description = A brainfuck interpreter written completely in Bro scripts.
   You probably shouldn't actually ever use this.  It's rather pointless
   and was only written to say that I wrote the first language
   interpreter in Bro.  If you do accidentally install it though, it
   won't cause any trouble unless you actually use it to run a 
   Brainfuck program.
